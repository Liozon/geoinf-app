## Introduction

The idea behind this application is to differentiate the different areas where it is allowed to fly his drone areas where it is prohibited.

Reliable data from the Swiss Confederation are used, as well as live weather data, to enhance and better organize your next flights.

This app was developped during the GeoInf course at the HEIG-VD school of Yverdon-les-Bains. While all comments in this code and ReadMe are in english, the content is displayed in french exclusively.

## Client-server architecture

In order to offer the best user experience possible, some data are stored on external services.
Thoses services, such as Swiss Confederation's Web Map Tiling Services (or WMTS) and CartoDB Services.
